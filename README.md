# Creating a .NET MAUI Column Chart to Visualize the Corporate Investment in AI
[Column charts](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts/chart-types/maui-column-chart) are useful for displaying changes in data over a specific period of time or for illustrating comparisons between different items.

## Customization:
The appearance of the column chart can be customized using properties such as [Fill](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartSeries_Fill), [PaletteBrushes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_PaletteBrushes), [CornerRadius](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ColumnSeries_CornerRadius), [Stroke](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ColumnSeries_Stroke), and [StrokeWidth](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.XYDataSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_XYDataSeries_StrokeWidth).

We can enhance the segment appearance using custom segment views and series classes.

## Plot area background view:
Any view can be added to the plot area using the [PlotAreaBackgroundView](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/appearance#plotting-area-customization) support, which is useful for adding relevant data.

In this example, we will explore the details of corporate investment in AI using the .NET MAUI Cartesian Chart.

In recent times, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a critical area for corporate funding, with businesses across diverse sectors recognizing its capacity to revolutionize their operations. The allure of AI investments lies in their ability to enhance productivity, drive innovation, and secure a competitive advantage.
